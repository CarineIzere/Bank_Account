The Payment Request Button lets your customers check out with Apple Pay, Google Pay, Chrome saved cards, and Microsoft Pay. When using an Apple Pay-enabled browser, your customer will see the button on the left below. When using a browser that supports the Payment Request API, they’ll see the button on the right below. Note that for demonstration purposes, these are just images, not live demos. You can read more about browser support in the Payment Request Button Quickstart.
